Team 1 Water Reporting
=====

This is our Android water reporting application for CS 2340 Objects and Design at Georgia Tech.

### Project Description
>We will create an application that supports finding clean drinking water and reporting on testing
>results. In many parts of the world, access to clean water is a severe problem.
>Many times, water is available, but people do not know where to get it. Other times,
>water may appear clean, but has unacceptable levels of contaminants.
>
>Even in areas where there is a lack of clean water, the population has access to devices on which
>applications can run. Most of these devices are smart phones so we will be writing an
>Android application.
>
>Our application will allow water reporting to crowd sourced. People can report on locations where
>water is available. Users of the application can find the nearest water source or report on a
>new water source. Workers with test kits will also be able to report on contaminant levels.
>The application will provide historical graphs to show variations in water quality over
>time for a specific location.
